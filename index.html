            Tired of the only crap Heardle playing music from the stone ages.
            Decided to recode this game in order to get more customization and playability.
            Hopefully it works better than the original.

            Listen to the intro, then find the correct song in the list.
            Skipping or incorrect guesses will allow you listen to more of the intro.
            Try your best to win with the smallest number of guesses possible!

      <!-- We can't use Deezer. -->
      <!--
      For Deezer API Use, add an option to filter for artists. The user should be prompted to select artists themselves.
      From these artists, assign them into an array and randomly select from that array (this allows for dynamic load).
      Once an artist is chosen retrieve top songs (100 songs max) and from there randomly select one song from that list

      ### CONCERN ###, Only concern is that either I have to make a list of artists ahead of time for filtering
      or dynamically check for the artists. Not sure which one is easier (Will know once coded)
